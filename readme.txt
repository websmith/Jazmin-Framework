What is Jazmin?
Jazmin is a lightweight but powerful HTML5/CSS3 framework for Convergence CMS. Jazmin is based on the popular HTML Kickstart framework http://99lime.com. While a new Convergence website includes some default styles that will get you started, the Jazmin framework offers a more robust and feature-rich boilerplate, and includes many updated technologies designers and developers can easily build upon. It was designed to be very customizable, yet it's easy to get it up-and-running fast. Jazmin is perfect for theming, prototyping and rapid iteration, and design enhancement. I’ve even included a separate install package for site retrofitting so you can adapt Jazmin to your pre-built projects without overriding your current styles. 

One of the beautiful things about Convergence is the flexibility to use your own HTML in any way you’d like. However, when you need the power of HTML5 in a pre-packaged, rapid-prototyping setup, Jazmin has you covered.


Why use Jazmin?
The Jazmin Framework shares some similarities to the default styles provided with a new install of Convergence and builds on those with new advanced functionality and customizations. You get the best of convergence with added features that allow you fastrack the building process and focus more on functionality and less on coding repetitive UI elements. 

Unlike many frameworks out there, Jazmin doesn't add hundreds of new classes you need to learn. It instead uses many of the classes already in place through Convergence and adds to those. Check out the features below to find out more about what sets Jazmin apart.


Responsive, Fluid Grid
Jazmin utilizes a fully fluid, percentage-based, twelve column grid system. Percentage-based grids insure you have a fluid layout between breakpoints; making for a better user experience and fewer hacks. Jazmin has a default 1000px container div, but you can use the grid system at any width you’d like. The grid breaks down nicely at the common mobile breakpoints and you can easily add more if you need to.


User Interface
Jazmin includes several new and useful UI elements to use in your designs. New buttons, icons, form styles, and even support for dropdowns - are just some of the elements included. 


Semantics
Jazmin provides you with every Convergence template. You can easily remove any templates you aren't using for your project. All templates are structured to get you started quickly without any unecessary frills. Convergence allows you to structure your code in any way you'd like and Jazmin doesn't limit you either, but it's ready for HTML5 out-of-the-box. 

Jazmin uses the newest elements in the HTML5 spec-recommended format in all of the pre-provided html templates. The CSS doesn't rely on these elements for styling so you can modify them or replace them as required by your project.


Browser Support
Jazmin supports all modern browsers including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, and IE10. Internet Explorer is supported all the way to version 8 with partial support and degredation for IE7. IE styles are availible to you if you'd like to target legacy browsers. Here are some examples:
.ie - targets all IE browsers up to version 9.
.ie7 - targets IE7.
.ie8 - targets IE8.
.ie9 - targets IE9.


Installation
For New Convergence Projects:
Once you have created a new convergence site, set up your project in your favorite Coder and download the Convergence files from the server. Once you have the Convergence install, you can install Jazmin in that directory. To do this you can either clone the repo directly, or download the .zip folder from github: https://github.com/websmith/Jazmin-Framework

Once you have Jazmin downloaded, drag the Jazmin files and folders into your project folder (root). This will override many of the default files and folders in your directory.Ensure you do NOT delete or otherwise modify the following folders:
files
items
photos
cart

These are permission based folders so you'll want to ensure they aren't changed or removed.

For existing Convergence projects:
To retrofit an existing project with Jazmin, copy only the files/folders you wish to override. Again, ensure that you do NOT override any of the folders listed above. Generally, for most projects, you will want to copy over only the files that are in folders. This will exclude the layout/HTML templates in the root of your project, though you may choose to include some of those files if you do not already have them in your project.

That's it! You're ready to get started with Jazmin.
